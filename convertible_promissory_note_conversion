##	In the event that the Company issues and sells shares of its Equity Securities to investors (the “Investors”) on or before the date of the repayment in full of this Note in an equity financing resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $[[Qualified Financing Amount]] (including the conversion of the Notes and other debt) (a “Qualified Financing”), then the outstanding principal balance of this Note shall automatically convert in whole without any further action by the Holder into such Equity Securities at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) [[Discount]]% of the per share price paid by the Investors [or (ii) the price equal to the quotient of $[[Valuation Cap]] divided by the aggregate number of outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock as of immediately prior to the initial closing of the Qualified Financing (assuming full conversion or exercise of all convertible and exercisable securities then outstanding other than the Notes)], and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as given to the Investors.  Any unpaid accrued interest on this Note shall be converted into Equity Securities on the same terms as the principal of the Notes. 
##	In the event that a Qualified Financing is not consummated prior to the Maturity Date, then, at the election of the Requisite Holders made at least five days prior to the Maturity Date, effective upon the Maturity Date, the outstanding principal balance and any unpaid accrued interest under this Note and each of the other Notes shall be converted into shares of Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to the quotient of $[[Valuation Cap]] divided by the aggregate number of outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock as of the Maturity Date (assuming full conversion or exercise of all convertible and exercisable securities then outstanding other than the Notes).    
##	If, after aggregation, the conversion of this Note would result in the issuance of a fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of issuance of any fractional share, pay the Holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the product resulting from multiplying the then current fair market value of one share of the class and series of capital stock into which this Note has converted by such fraction.
##	Notwithstanding any provision of this Note to the contrary, in the event that the Company consummates a Sale of the Company (as defined below) prior to the conversion or repayment in full of this Note, (i) the Company will give the Holder at least five days prior written notice of the anticipated closing date of such Sale of the Company and (ii) at the closing of such Sale of the Company, in lieu of the principal and interest that would otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date, the Company will pay the Holder an aggregate amount equal to [[Sale Multiple]] times the aggregate amount of principal and interest then outstanding under this Note in full satisfaction of the Company’s obligations under this Note.
##	For purposes of this Note: 
###	“Sale of the Company” shall mean (i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, other than any such consolidation, merger or reorganization in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, continue to hold at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity in substantially the same proportions (or, if the surviving entity is a wholly owned subsidiary, its parent) immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization; (ii) any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in excess of 50% of the Company’s voting power is transferred; provided, however, that a Sale of the Company shall not include any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor or indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof; or (iii) a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. 
###	“Equity Securities” shall mean the Company’s Preferred Stock or any securities conferring the right to purchase the Company’s Preferred Stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable for (with or without additional consideration), the Company’s Preferred Stock, except that such defined term shall not include any security (x) granted, issued and/or sold by the Company to any employee, director or consultant in such capacity or (y) issued upon the conversion or exercise of any option or warrant outstanding as of the date of this Note.
